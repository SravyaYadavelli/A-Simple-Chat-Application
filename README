In my project, both pthread and select() are used to handle multiple I/O operations in a single thread of execution.

In chat_Server.c, 
I used select() to multiplex the I/O operations of all connected clients in a single thread. 
Whenever there is data to be read from a client or a new client wants to connect, select() will notify the server thread, which will handle the event accordingly. 
In this way, we can handle multiple client connections in a single thread without having to create a new thread for each client.

In chat_client.c, 
I used pthread to create two threads: one for reading user input from stdin and sending it to the server, and another for receiving messages from the server and displaying them to the user. 
In this way, the client program can handle user input and server messages simultaneously without blocking the main thread.
